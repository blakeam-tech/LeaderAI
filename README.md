# LeaderAI: Enhanced Mistral 7B Model for Analyzing International Politics

## Project Description

LeaderAI fine-tunes the Mistral 7B model to enhance its capabilities in analyzing international politics and approaching problems like world leaders such as Xi Jinping. 

The project involves collaboration with experts in international politics and utilizes methods such as TF-IDF vectorization and KMeans clustering to improve the model's accuracy and responsiveness by identifying and categorizing output failures.

## Key Features

- **Feedback Processing:** Employs TF-IDF vectorization and KMeans clustering to sort expert feedback and pinpoint specific types of errors, such as inaccuracies or issues with summarization.
- **Synthetic Data Generation:** Uses synthetic data tailored to identified failure categories to refine the modelâ€™s training and increase its precision.
- **Predictive Failure Intervention:** Features a built-in classifier designed to foresee potential inaccuracies, prompting users to provide more precise inputs to enhance the quality of responses.
